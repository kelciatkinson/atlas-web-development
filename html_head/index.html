        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey! My name is Kelci. I use she/her pronouns. I'm currently a T3 Full-Stack student at Atlas School. I'm looking forward to working in Tulsa after graduating and helping an organization with their web needs. I have been interested in coding for over 2 years after a friend introduced me to a free bootcamp for women and gender expansive people. I was one of those people who thought of technical jobs as only accessible for white men who learned how to code at 5 years old. Ever since learning a bit of Python during the pandemic, I have been passionate about learning more marketable skills to attain an equitable jobby job.</p>
